    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.
    -->
    <!--
        configure google_maps_key and google_app_id :::
        1-turn on VPN
        2-sign-in into your google account
        3-open this link :
            https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&reusekey=true
        4-create new project or use existing googleConsole project
        5-create new api key in your googleConsole
        6-in the result form you'll see two section
            package name  & SHA-1 certificate fingerprint
          you should get two SHA-1 certificate for your app and put them into this form

            7-a)get debug certificate :
                Locate your debug keystore file. The file name is debug.keystore, and is created the first time you build your project.
                By default, it is stored in the same directory as your Android Virtual Device (AVD) files:
                C:\Users\your_user_name\.android\
                remember this location for your debug.keystore

                go to the keytool in java path : C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_91\bin
                open command prompt over there
                List the SHA-1 fingerprint by this command :
                    keytool -list -v -keystore "%USERPROFILE%\.android\debug.keystore" -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android
                in the result you'll see debug SHA-1 key (use this for googleConsole)
            7-b)get release certificate :
                remember your signature keystore file location
                go to the keytool in java path : C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_91\bin
                open command prompt over there
                List the SHA-1 fingerprint by this command :
                    keytool -list -v -keystore your_keystore_fullpath -alias your_alias_name
                in the result you'll see release SHA-1 key (use this for googleConsole)
        8-name your api key and press save button
          Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza") replace it in your google_maps_api.xml google_maps_key section
        9-last thing that you should do is get google_app_id
          at the top of your googleConsole on the right section beside send feedback button you'll see your project name
          click on it
          in front of your project name you'll see your project id
          copy it and replace it in google_maps_api.xml google_app_id section

        All done !!:D
